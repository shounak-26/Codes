# This is a simple program in which we can find out the qudrants of given co-ordinate in python by using if-elif-else statement.

x = int(input("x co-ordinate:"))
y = int(input("y co-ordinate:"))

if (x>0 and y>0):
    print("x and y lies in Ist quadrant")
elif(x<0 and y>0):
    print("x and y lies in IInd quadrant")
elif(x<0 and y<0):
    print("x and y lies in IIIrd quadrant")
else:
    print("x and y lies at origin")
